# BashChat
A Terminal based chat software in which a user can enter a ip and port to connect to and chat over.

<<<TO USE BASH CHAT YOU WILL NEED PYTHON INSTALLED (not entirely sure the minimal python version quite yet, but something near latest, most likely 3.9 or above!)>>>

To use BashChat, download the client.py file and run it, then aquire a code (ip and port) from wherever you get them from and enjoy.

To host a server you need one open port. To start download the server.py, run it and enter the ip you want to host over, the server should be running from there, it will provide a join code (the string people join with) give that to whoever you want to join the chat and enjoy.
