Hey! thanks for reading. I would like to ask that if you are making a custom client for Bashchat or Different server. Please dont make it for the purpose of hurting others. Spamming or crashing clients or infecting with malware is not cool. I spent my time making this application as a cool chat app, i dont want it to become a fight. Especially considering im a terrible programmer. I would have no idea how to stop these things. So all i can do is just ask kindly.
